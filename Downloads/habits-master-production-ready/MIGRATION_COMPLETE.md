## 🔐 Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- **User data isolation** - users can only access their own data
- **Secure authentication** with Supabase Auth
- **API key protection** with proper role-based access

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Set Up Database Schema**
Run the SQL from `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create all tables and security policies.

### 2. **Test the App**
- Try signing up with a new account
- Test all features (prayer requests, reading progress, etc.)
- Verify data is being saved to Supabase

### 3. **Configure Authentication (Optional)**
- Enable additional auth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Set up email templates
- Configure password policies

### 4. **Deploy to Production**
- Update environment variables
- Configure production Supabase project
- Deploy your app
