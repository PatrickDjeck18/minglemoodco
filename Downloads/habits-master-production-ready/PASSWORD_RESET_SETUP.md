# Password Reset Setup Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The forget password functionality has been successfully connected to Supabase! Here's what was implemented:

### What's Working

1. **LoginScreen Integration**: The "Forgot Password?" button now triggers the Supabase password reset functionality
2. **Email Validation**: Users must enter a valid email address before requesting a password reset
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are displayed if the reset fails
4. **Success Feedback**: Users receive confirmation when the reset email is sent

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. Updated LoginScreen.tsx
- Added `resetPassword` to the `useAuth` hook destructuring
- Replaced the placeholder `handleForgotPassword` function with a fully functional implementation
- Added proper email validation and error handling
- Added success message with instructions for users

#### 2. Supabase Integration
- Uses `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email)` method
- Leverages the existing Supabase configuration in `src/utils/config.ts`
- Works with the existing AuthContext implementation

### How It Works

1. User enters their email address in the login form
2. User clicks "Forgot Password?"
3. App validates the email format
4. App calls Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail` method
5. Supabase sends a password reset email to the user
6. User receives confirmation message in the app

### Supabase Configuration Required

To ensure password reset emails are sent properly, you need to configure the following in your Supabase dashboard:

#### 1. Authentication Settings
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Set the **Site URL** to your app's URL (e.g., `https://yourapp.com` for production)
3. Add your app's URL to **Redirect URLs** if needed

#### 2. Email Settings
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Email**
2. Ensure **Enable email confirmations** is set appropriately for your needs
3. Configure **SMTP settings** for production use (optional for development)

#### 3. Email Templates (Optional)
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Email Templates**
2. Customize the password reset email template if desired
3. The default template will work fine for most use cases

### Testing the Functionality

1. **Start the app**: `npm start` or `expo start`
2. **Navigate to Login**: Go to the login screen
3. **Enter an email**: Type a valid email address
4. **Click "Forgot Password?"**: Tap the forgot password link
5. **Check for success message**: You should see "Password Reset Email Sent"
6. **Check email**: Look for the password reset email (check spam folder)

### Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:

1. **SMTP Configuration**: Set up a proper SMTP service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
2. **Custom Email Templates**: Brand the password reset emails
3. **Rate Limiting**: The current config allows 2 emails per hour per IP
4. **Redirect URLs**: Ensure proper redirect URLs are configured for your domain

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **"Email not sent"**: Check Supabase SMTP configuration
2. **"Invalid email"**: Ensure email format validation is working
3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait before trying again (2 emails/hour limit)
4. **"Email in spam"**: Check spam folder, consider custom email templates

#### Debug Steps:

1. Check Supabase dashboard logs under **Logs** → **Auth**
2. Verify email configuration in **Authentication** → **Settings**
3. Test with a known working email address
4. Check network connectivity and Supabase service status

### Security Notes

- Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour by default
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (2 emails per hour per IP)
- Users must have a valid account to receive reset emails
- The reset link is only valid for the specific user and expires after use

## ✅ Ready to Use!

The password reset functionality is now fully integrated with Supabase and ready for use. Users can reset their passwords by following the email instructions sent by Supabase.
