The Christian Habits Tracker is built on biblical principles:

- **Gratitude**: "Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus" (1 Thessalonians 5:18)
- **Fasting**: "But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face" (Matthew 6:17)
- **Service**: "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve" (Mark 10:45)
- **Fellowship**: "And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works" (Hebrews 10:24)

This comprehensive Christian habits tracking system provides believers with the tools they need to grow spiritually through consistent, intentional practices rooted in biblical truth.
